Before calling function : a = 5 & b = 6
during calling function : a = 6 & b = 26   
after calling function  : a = 6 & b = 26
Before executing the function, nothing will change, and during execution, the first value will increase by 1, the second value will increase by 20, and will be printed. 
After that, the last print line will be executed and print the changed values, because the pointer changes numbers, not just takes a copy.
